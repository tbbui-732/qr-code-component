# Welcome! ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³

## What is this? 
This is a very basic frontend mentor challenge to test my HTML and CSS skills

## What are the technologies used? 
Nothing besides pure HTML and CSS. 

## How is it built? 
In order to create the QR code container, I created a div named "qr-container" and used a flexbox container in order to horizontally align the elements. 

## Design to attempt
